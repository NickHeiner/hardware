Hardware documentation for the Tessel

Welcome to the new and improved (but likely not final) documentation for Tessel hardware! At this point, we will be rolling out documentation as it gets written and all the underlying firmware and drivers stabilize. Things may change regarding organization, but likely not regarding content.

For the time being, exisiting beta documentation has been moved to the beta folder.

If you think something is missing, don't hesitate to reach out.

### What's here

* [An overview of the Teseel hardware, including key parts and pinouts](./tessel-hardware-overview.md)
* [A hardware-centric overview of each of the modules that will be released at launch](./modules-overview.md)
* [A guide on how to power the Tessel](./powering-tessel.md)
